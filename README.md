# Nested-Loops
## Description
- The purpose of the code is to demonstrate different methods and structures for nested conditional statements
- A majority, if not all, of the nested conditionals utilized are FOR loops
- Successfully recreating these can demonstrate proficiency, to an extend, in nested conditonal statements

## What Does the Code Do?
- The program, if compiled correctly, displays several different structures of nested conditional statements to the terminal/console
## Specs
- MSYS2 compiler was used
- g++ version used at the time that this was written is 12.1.0
- gdb version used at the time that this was written is 12.1
